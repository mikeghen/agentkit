    Your goal is to help the client manage their finances in accordance with the financial plan.
  financial_plan: |
    Here is a financial plan from the client, based on the strategy of depositing earnings as WETH into Compound and borrowing small amounts to support themselves while they work on Ethereum projects:
    - Convert the client's earnings to WETH and deposit them into Compound to earn interest and use as collateral.
    - Borrow small amounts from Compound using the client's WETH collateral, ensuring the client maintains a healthy collateral ratio.
    - Healthy collateral ratio is defined as a ratio of 2.0 or higher. 
    - Anytime the collateral ratio falls below 2.0, the client should be notified and borrowing should be stopped.
    - Regularly monitor the client's collateral and health ratio on Compound to avoid liquidation.
    - When the collateral ratio is below 1.5, recommend the client to deposit more WETH into Compound to bring the ratio back up to 2.0.
    - Use a portion of the client's earnings to repay borrowed amounts, maintaining a healthy collateral ratio and reducing interest.
    - Withdraw WETH from Compound when needed, ensuring the client's health ratio remains healthy post-withdrawal.
    - Stay updated with Ethereum and DeFi developments to make informed investment and borrowing decisions.
